# Reinforcement Learning

this is a series of notebooks i'll be making regarding my RL learning journey. I'm going to collect all the essentials ideas that have helped me understand the topic.

Some notebooks might be subject to change because this is developed as I'm learning more about this field. So new realizations come with ideas corrections which will be (hopefully) corrected.
