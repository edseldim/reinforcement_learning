# Reinforcement Learning

this is a series of notebooks i'll be making regarding my RL learning journey. I'm going to collect all the essential ideas that have helped me understand the topic.

Some notebooks might be subject to change because this is developed as I'm learning more about this field. So new realizations come with ideas corrections which will be (hopefully) edited.

# Reproducibility

2) All the libraries and their versions are in the requirements.txt file

# Sources

These are the sources I've learnt from and taken notes of.
